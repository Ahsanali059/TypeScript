->The `keyof operator` in TypeScript is used to obtain a type that represents all the keys of a given type. 

->It is particularly useful when you need to create more dynamic and flexible code by referencing the keys of an object type directly.

Usage of keyof Operator
The keyof operator returns a union type of the keys of the type you pass to it. This can be useful for type-checking and ensuring that you are working with valid property names.

`Practical Example`

interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  email: string;
}

// keyof Person produces the union type "name" | "age" | "email"
type PersonKeys = keyof Person;

let key: PersonKeys;

key = "name"; // valid
key = "age"; // valid
key = "email"; // valid
key = "address"; // invalid, as "address" is not a key of Person

Why We Use keyof
Type Safety: Ensures that only valid keys are used, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.
Dynamic Programming: Allows for more flexible and reusable code by dynamically referencing properties of objects.
Utility Types: keyof is often used in conjunction with utility types like Record, Pick, and Omit to create more advanced types.
