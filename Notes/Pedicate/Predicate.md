-> In simple words, a predicate in TypeScript is a special kind of function that checks if a variable is of a specific type. If the function returns true, TypeScript knows that the variable is indeed of that type for the rest of the code within that block. This helps TypeScript ensure that you are using the variable correctly and safely.

Example
->Imagine you have two types of pets: Dogs and Cats. You want to write a function that checks if a pet is a Dog.

Here's how you can do it:

interface Dog {
  bark: () => void;
}

interface Cat {
  meow: () => void;
}

2-Create a function to check if a pet is a Dog:

function isDog(pet: Dog | Cat): pet is Dog {
  return (pet as Dog).bark !== undefined;
}

-> This function returns true if the pet can bark, meaning it's a Dog.
