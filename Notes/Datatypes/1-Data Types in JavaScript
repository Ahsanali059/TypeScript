Data Types in JavaScript:

There are three main primitives in JavaScript and TypeScript.

	boolean - true or false values
	number - whole numbers and floating point values
	string - text values like "TypeScript Rocks"
	There are also 2 less common primitives used in later versions of Javascript and TypeScript.

	bigint - whole numbers and floating point values, but allows larger negative and positive numbers than the number type.
	symbol are used to create a globally unique identifier.

->Type Assignment

When creating a variable, there are two main ways TypeScript assigns a type:

	Explicit
	Implicit
1-Explicit Type:writing out the type:
      let firstName: string = "Dylan";

Explicit type assignment are easier to read and more intentional.

2-Implicit Type:
TypeScript will "guess" the type, based on the assigned value:
let firstName = "Dylan";

Note: Having TypeScript "guess" the type of a value is called infer.

Implicit assignment forces TypeScript to infer the value.
Implicit type assignment are shorter, faster to type, and often used when developing and testing.

TypeScript will throw an error if data types do not match.

let firstName: string = "Dylan"; // type string
firstName = 33; // attempts to re-assign the value to a different type

JavaScript will not throw an error for mismatched types.
