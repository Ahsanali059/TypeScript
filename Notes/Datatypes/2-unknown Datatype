unknown Datatype:

unknown is a similar, but safer alternative to any.

unknown is a type introduced in TypeScript to represent values about which we have little or no information.

It is more restrictive than the any type, requiring type-checking before performing most operations with values of the unknown type.

2-Use Cases:
When the type of a value is not known until runtime.
When working with values from dynamic sources, such as user inputs or external APIs.

Type: never

never effectively throws an error whenever it is defined.
let x: never = true; // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'never'.

never is rarely used, especially by itself, its primary use is in advanced generics.


Type: undefined & null
undefined and null are types that refer to the JavaScript primitives undefined and null respectively.

These types don't have much use unless strictNullChecks is enabled in the tsconfig.json file.
