->`Utility Types` in Typescript are predefined generic types provided by language to facilitate common type transformation and operations.
->They help streamline the process of creating,transforming,and manipulating types,making code more concise and readable 

Common Utility Types

(1)->Partial<T>
(2)->Required<T>
(3)->Readonly<T>
(4)->Record<K, T>
(5)->Pick<T, K>
(6)->Omit<T, K>
(7)->Exclude<T, U>
(8)->Extract<T, U>
(9)->NonNullable<T>
(10)->ReturnType<T>

Question #1:

Why Use Utility Types

1-`Reduce Boilerplate`: Simplifies the creation and manipulation of types, reducing repetitive code.

2-`Enhance Readability`: Makes code easier to read and understand by providing clear, concise type definitions.

3-`Increase Type Safety`: Helps catch errors at compile-time by ensuring type correctness.

4-`Flexibility`: Provides powerful tools to dynamically create and modify types, making code more adaptable and reusable.

`Maintainability`: Improves maintainability by centralizing type transformations and ensuring consistency across the codebase.
